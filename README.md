# DrugRepPT: a deep pre-training and fine-tuning framework for drug repositioning based on drugâ€™s expression perturbation and treatment effectiveness 
## 1. Introduction
This repository contains source code and datasets for the paper "DrugRepPT: a deep pre-training and fine-tuning framework for drug repositioning based on drugâ€™s expression perturbation and treatment effectiveness". In this study, we proposed a deep pre-training and fine-tuning framework for drug repositioning. First, we design a graph pre-training module with model-augmented contrastive learning on a large drug-disease heterogeneous graph, to capture the rich features of intricate interactions and expression perturbation after intervention. We introduce a fine-tuning module of graph residual-like convolution network to capture sophisticated interactions among diseases and drugs, and a Bayesian multi-loss to effectively equilibrate both existence and effectiveness contrast of drug treatment.

## 3. Install Python libraries needed
```
$ conda create -n DrugRepPT_envs python=3.9
$ conda activate DrugRepPT_envs
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 4. Methods
The graph pre-training module uses graph contrast learning code from [MA-GCL](https://github.com/GXM1141/MA-GCL), and the fine-tuning module uses graph residual-like convolution network from [LR-GCCF](https://github.com/newlei/LR-GCCF).
